Ideas of improvement
====================

1. Replace the 'auth-cli' in the tex file by a dedicated tutorial

2. Seperate the step where the graph is created from the calculation
    * command that creates the graph
    * command that init the values and does the computation

    * It may also be 'intelligent' enough to ask if the graph is created on the
      nodes, and create it if necessary

3. Allow reading more complex commands on the node instead of only characters
